# Astro + Solid-JS + TailwindCSS Template

An [Astro](https://astro.build) project template with the following additions:

- Solid
- TailwindCSS
- Prettier with Astro plug-in. NOTE: We were going to use the Tailwind Prettier plug-in but it currently has issues working with other plug-ins (see [this issue](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/31)). There is also a couple of [other](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro/issues/272) [issues](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro/issues/260) in the Astro plugin at the time of writing.  Thus Layout.astro is currently excluded from Prettier processing (see .prettierignore).
- ESLint with Typescript and eslint-plugin-tailwindcss plugins.  The Tailwind ESLint plugin is being used as a workaround for the current problems in the Prettier Tailwind plugin.
