# Astro + Solid-JS + TailwindCSS Template

An [Astro](https://astro.build) project template with the following additions:

- Solid
- TailwindCSS
- Prettier with Astro plug-in. NOTE: We were going to use the Tailwind Prettier plug-in but it currently has issues working with other plug-ins (see [this issue](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/31)). There is also a couple of [other](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro/issues/272) [issues](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro/issues/260) in the Astro plugin at the time of writing. Thus Layout.astro is currently excluded from Prettier processing (see .prettierignore).
- ESLint with Typescript and TailwindCSS plugins. The Tailwind ESLint plugin is being used as a workaround for the current problems in the Prettier TailwindCSS plugin.

## Usage

```shell
# Typescript + tailwindcss template
$ pnpx degit phillipbaird/template-astro-solid-tailwindcss my-astro-project
$ cd my-astro-project
$ pnpm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

This templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.  This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
